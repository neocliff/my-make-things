# component . mk - component description file for 'COMPONENT_NAME Â·
#
#						TAILORING INSTRUCTIONS
# this file contains the component-specific build instructions. in POWDER
# KEG, we build one of three things: a complete binary, an archive, or a set of
# object files . if building a binary, use the BIN_BUILT noun. if building an
# archive, use the LIB_BUILT noun. if building to object files, no specific
# noun is required; OBJ_FILES is built automatically .
#
# if this component is being built 'for' another component, for example,
# the 'aes' component is being build for 'crypto', use the BUILD_FOR noun
# on the invocation . this is usually done when a subcomponent needs an element
# from the component it is being built for, for example, Config.h or Globals.h.
# the make command is:
#       make TARGET_TYPE=<target> \
#        	 BUILD_TYPE=<debug|release> \
#		     BUILD_FOR=<component> \
#		     ../../../build_system/build_library/makeile <target>
#
# the use of the BUILD_FOR noun is component specific, i.e, the component.mk
# file needs to define how BUILD_FOR is used in constructing file paths, etc.

# define identifiers for this component. these should be used to build names and
# paths for this component.
MODULE_NAME		= example

# build a binary out of this
BIN_BUILT=${MODULE_NAME}.${MODULE_SUFFIX}

# build an archive out of this. archives normally have a '.ar' suffix.
#LIB_BUILT = ${MODULE_NAME}.${MODULE_SUFFIX}

# define the list of include directories to seach in order. do not include '-I'
# as it is added by the make system automatically . examples of paths are:
#	${I_AM_AT_FULL}/include - the 'include' subdirectory in component directory
#	${PROJ_SRC_SHARED}/interfaces/include - the 'include' subdirectory in
#			the ' shared/ component ' directory
#	${PROJ_SRC}/${BUILD_FOR}/include - the 'include' subdirectory of the component

#                                WARNING
# when adding source files to EXPORTED_INTERFACES, EXTERNAL_SOURCES, or
# C_SRC_FILES, use relative path names rather than absolute. this is
# because the step to convert C_SRC_FILES to OBJ_FILES will prepend the
# absolute path COMP_OBJ_DIR. if files in the C_SRC_FILES already have an
# absolute path, you will get something like:
#   /home/user/repo/src/hello/obj/debug/x86_32//home/user/repo/src/hello/c_dir/c.o

# identify the source files to be compiled/assembled. first, identify the
# interfaces of this component that are going to be exported to other
# components.
EXPORTED_INTERFACES	=

# next identify, source files that are outside this specific subtree, e.g.,
# "${PROJ_SRC_SHARED}/<element/paths>/<file.c>", of the repo filesystem.
EXTERNAL_SOURCES	= 

# lastly, identify the source files that are inside this specific subtree of
# the repo filesystem. make sure that if you use ${EXPORTED_INTERFACES} and/or
# ${EXTERNAL_SOURCES}, append them to ${C_SRC_FILES}.
