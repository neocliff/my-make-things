# my-make-things

This repo contains a complete make system that (hopefully) 
scales-up to support building a complex project. This code
started with maxtrua's Makefile project for handling dependency
files (generation and loading) and grew from there. I built this
as a skeleton for a large project at work.

## Organization of Make Files

How the make system is laid out...
* hello/makefile - the main driver for everything
* hello/component.mk - defines the component being built
* build_system/build_library/defaults.mk - contains the default 
definitions of tools, etc used in this project
* build_system/build_library/compiler_rules.mk - define's the 
default recipes to comile, etc

## make Targets

A standard set of targets are defined in the makefile. use
these target to build, etc.
* all - this is the default target and it directs make to build
everything
* clean - use this target  clean-up flotsam from a prior build
but leave some things as they are, e.g., the dependency files
* cleanall - use this target to clean-up everything that was
generated by a prior build
* checkit - outputs the configuration of the make system for
this component
